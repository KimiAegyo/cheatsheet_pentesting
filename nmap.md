Nmap (Network Mapper) is a network scanner free and open-source network.
It is one of the best network exploration tools that allows you to discover
hosts and services by sending packets and analyzing them answers.
It also has the ability to detect OS and their version as well as firewall evasion for example.

### For Basic Usage :
- **Scan a single target** :
  ```
  nmap [target]
  ```

- **Scan multiple targets** :
  ```
  nmap [target1] [target2] ...
  ```

- **Scan an entire subnet** :
  ```
  nmap [subnet]
  ```

- **Scan a range of IP addresses** :
  ```
  nmap [range of IPs]
  ```

### For Scan Types :
- **TCP SYN scan (default)** :
  ```
  nmap -sS [target]
  ```

- **TCP connect scan** :
  ```
  nmap -sT [target]
  ```

- **UDP scan** :
  ```
  nmap -sU [target]
  ```

- **TCP ACK scan** :
  ```
  nmap -sA [target]
  ```

### For Service and Version Detection :
- **Detect service versions** :
  ```
  nmap -sV [target]
  ```

- **Aggressive scan** (enables service/version detection, OS detection, and traceroute) :
  ```
  nmap -A [target]
  ```

### For OS Detection :
- **Detect operating system** :
  ```
  nmap -O [target]
  ```

### For Output Options :
- **Save output to a file** :
  ```
  nmap -oN [filename] [target]
  ```

- **Save output in all major formats** :
  ```
  nmap -oA [basename] [target]
  ```

### For Timing Options :
- **Timing template (0-5, higher is faster but less stealthy)** :
  ```
  nmap -T[0-5] [target]
  ```

### For Firewall Evasion Techniques :
- **Fragment packets** :
  ```
  nmap -f [target]
  ```

- **Spoof MAC address** :
  ```
  nmap --spoof-mac [MAC address] [target]
  ```

### For Scripting Engine :
- **Run Nmap scripts** :
  ```
  nmap -sC [target]
  ```

### For Miscellaneous :
- **Verbose output** :
  ```
  nmap -v [target]
  ```

- **List available NSE scripts** :
  ```
  ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
  ```

- **List targets from an Nmap scan file** :
  ```
  nmap -iL [filename]
  ```
