MIFARE is a widely used technology for contactless smart cards and proximity cards.
It is commonly employed in various applications such as access control systems, public transportation fare collection, and electronic payment systems.
MIFARE cards operate on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and are known for their security features and ease of use.

### For Basic Usage :

- **List available MIFARE card readers** :
    ```bash
    mfoc -P
    ```

### For Attack :

- **Scan for MIFARE cards (with specific readers)** :
    ```bash
    mfoc -P 0
    ```

- **Dump MIFARE card data** :
    ```bash
    mfoc -P 0 -O <output_file>
    ```

- **Crack MIFARE keys (with a dictionary attack)** :
    ```bash
    mfoc -P 0 -O <output_file.extension> -k <key_file>
    ```

- **Read specific MIFARE card blocks** :
    ```bash
    mifare-classic-read-ndef -k <key_file> <block_number>
    ```

- **Write data to MIFARE card blocks (with specific key file, block number, and data)** :
    ```bash
    mifare-classic-write-ndef -k <key_file> <block_number> <data>
    ```

- **Analyzing captured data** :
> Use tools like `MFOC`, `mfocgui`, or `mfoc-mfcuk` to analyze captured data and extract information from MIFARE cards.
