TCPDUMP is a data-network packet analyzer computer program that runs under a command line interface.
It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached.
Distributed under the BSD license, tcpdump is free software.

**CATEGORY** = _**Mobile Security**_ \
**SUB-CATEGORY** = _**Wireless Analyzers**_

### For Basic Usage :
- **Capture packets on a specific interface** :
  ```
  tcpdump -i [interface]
  ```

- **Capture packets on a specific port** :
  ```
  tcpdump port [port]
  ```

- **Capture packets from a specific host** :
  ```
  tcpdump host [host]
  ```

- **Capture packets from a specific network** :
  ```
  tcpdump net [network]
  ```

### For Filtering :
- **Apply BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) filter** :
  ```
  tcpdump [BPF filter]
  ```

- **Capture only TCP packets** :
  ```
  tcpdump tcp
  ```

- **Capture only UDP packets** :
  ```
  tcpdump udp
  ```

- **Capture only ICMP packets** :
  ```
  tcpdump icmp
  ```

### For Output Control :
- **Write captured packets to a file** :
  ```
  tcpdump -w [filename]
  ```

- **Read captured packets from a file** :
  ```
  tcpdump -r [filename]
  ```

- **Print packet timestamp** :
  ```
  tcpdump -tttt
  ```

- **Limit the number of packets to capture** :
  ```
  tcpdump -c [count]
  ```

### For Display Format :
- **Print in ASCII format** :
  ```
  tcpdump -A
  ```

- **Print in HEX and ASCII format** :
  ```
  tcpdump -X
  ```

### For Miscellaneous:
- **Monitor DNS traffic** :
  ```
  tcpdump port 53
  ```

- **Monitor HTTP traffic** :
  ```
  tcpdump port 80
  ```

- **Monitor HTTPS traffic** :
  ```
  tcpdump port 443
  ```

- **Monitor traffic between two hosts** :
  ```
  tcpdump host [host1] and host [host2]
  ```

- **Monitor traffic between two networks** :
  ```
  tcpdump net [network1] and net [network2]
  ```

> EXEMPLE USAGE :

- **Capture all HTTP traffic on eth0** :
  ```
  tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
  ```

- **Capture all ICMP traffic from 192.168.1.100** :
  ```
  tcpdump -i eth0 src host 192.168.1.100 and icmp
  ```

- **Save captured packets to a file named capture.pcap** :
  ```
  tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
  ```

- **Read packets from a capture file and display detailed information** :
  ```
  tcpdump -v -r capture.pcap
  ```
