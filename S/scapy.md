Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program and library for Python.
Scapy can be used to perform various types of attacks, such as denial of service (DoS) attacks or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
This can be useful for testing the security of a network and identifying vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.

### For Basic Usage :

- **Start Scapy in Interactive mode** :
     ```bash
     scapy
     ```

- **Help Information** :
     ```bash
     help()
     ```

- **Exit Scapy Interactive mode** :
     ```bash
     exit()
     ```

### For Packet Request :

- **Send ICMP Echo Request (ping)** :
     ```bash
     send(IP(dst="<target_ip>")/ICMP())
     ```

- **Send TCP SYN Packet to a specific port** :
     ```bash
     send(IP(dst="<target_ip>")/TCP(dport=<port>, flags="S"))
     ```

- **Send UDP Packet to a specific port** :
     ```bash
     send(IP(dst="<target_ip>")/UDP(dport=<port>))
     ```

- **Craft Custom Packet (with specific fields)** :
     ```bash
     pkt = IP(dst="<target_ip>")/ICMP()/"<Custom Payload>"
     send(pkt)
     ```

- **Sniff Packets of Network** :
     ```bash
     sniff(filter="<BPF_filter_expression>", count=<num_packets>)
     ```

- **Load Packet from PCAP File** :
     ```bash
     packets = rdpcap("<path/filename.pcap>")
     ```

- **Send captured Packet to Wireshark (for detailed analysis in Wireshark format)** :
     ```bash
     pkt.show()
     ```
